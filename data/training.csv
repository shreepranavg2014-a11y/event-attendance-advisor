## 3) Deploy to Vercel (GitHub → Vercel)
- Push these changes to GitHub (commit + push).  
- In Vercel: “New Project” → import your GitHub repo → Deploy.  
- Your API will be available at:
  - `https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app/health`
  - `https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app/predict/attendance`  
Vercel supports FastAPI deployments through its Python runtime and routing to your app entrypoint.[2][1]

## 4) Next (to match your full plan)
- Create real datasets: `students.csv`, `events.csv`, `attendance.csv`, then build a *joined training table* like your plan’s “Student × Event” records.  
- Upgrade the model: keep Logistic Regression as baseline, then move to XGBoost/LightGBM and add SHAP feature explanations (your plan’s interpretability requirement).  

Do you want the next step to be (A) designing the real CSV/DB schema for students/events/attendance, or (B) wiring your existing Excel attendance file into the training dataset first?
